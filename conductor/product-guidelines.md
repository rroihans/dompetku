# Product Guidelines: Dompetku

## Visual Identity & UX
- **High Contrast & Information Dense:** The interface should maximize data visibility. Power users need to see balances, upcoming installments, and recent transactions without excessive scrolling.
- **Clarity over Flourish:** Prioritize legible typography and clear distinctions between different account types and transaction categories.
- **Efficient Navigation:** Ensure common actions (like adding a transaction or checking the installment schedule) are accessible with minimal clicks.
- **Grouped & Logical Menu:** Use hierarchical menus (Sidebar groups, Drawer sections) to organize features into logical categories (Analisis, Perencanaan, Utama) to handle increasing app complexity.

## Tone of Voice & Messaging
- **Professional & Trustworthy:** Use precise, formal language. Financial data is sensitive; the app's communication must reflect accuracy and reliability.
- **Clear & Concise:** Avoid jargon where possible, but use standard financial terminology (debit, credit, interest, tenor) to maintain professional standards.
- **Security-First Language:** Messaging regarding data handling or system logs should reinforce the user's trust in the platform's integrity.

## Design Principles
- **Data-Driven Layouts:** Charts and tables are the primary components. They should be interactive and provide drill-down capabilities for deeper analysis.
- **Consistent Visual Cues:** Use a standardized color palette for different transaction types (e.g., green for income, red for expenses) and account categories to allow for rapid visual scanning.
